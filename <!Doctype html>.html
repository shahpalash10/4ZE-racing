  <h1> Front-End Developer</h1>
  <p>
    The main responsibility of a Front-End Developer is the User interface.

Simply put, create things that the user sees.
TML, CSS, and JavaScript are the basic languages you need to know to create a website.

To become a Front-End Developer, start with the subjects below, in the following order:

You have to code to learn how to code. Practice a lot!

Create the structure with HTML. The first thing you have to learn is HTML, which is the standard markup language for creating web pages.
Learn HTML
Style with CSS. The next step is to learn CSS, to set the layout of your web page with beautiful colors, fonts, and much more.
Learn CSS
Make it interactive with JavaScript. After studying HTML and CSS, you should learn JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive web pages for your users.

    <h1>Headless Browsers</h1>
    <p>
      Headless browsers are a web browser without a graphical user interface that can be controlled from a command line interface programmatically for the purpose of web page automation (e.g., functional testing, scraping, unit testing, etc.). Think of headless browsers as a browser that you can run from the command line that can retrieve and traverse web pages.

    <h1>Webviews</h1>
    <p>
      Webviews are used by a native OS, in a native application, to run web pages. Think of a webview like an iframe or a single tab from a web browser that is embedded in a native application running on a device (e.g., iOS, android, windows).

The most common solutions for webview development are:

Cordova (typically for native phone/tablet apps)
NW.js (typically used for desktop apps)
Electron (typically used for desktop apps)
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="relative">
    <h1>This is positioning relative to the given text</h1>
    <p>an element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.

Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="form">
    <h1> A full width input field</h1>
    <label for="fname">First Name</label>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname">
  </div>
  
<div class="fixed">
  <h1>This positioned text will not move from its given position</h1>
  <p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.

A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.

    <h1>Native from Web Tech</h1>
    <p>
      Eventually, what is learned from web browser development can be used by front-end developers to craft code for environments that are not fueled by a browser engine. As of late, development environments are being dreamed up that use web technologies (e.g., CSS and JavaScript), without web engines, to create native applications.

Some examples of these environments are:

Flutter
React Native
